Severe malaria is commonly misdiagnosed in Africa, leading to a failure to treat other life-threatening illnesses. In malaria-endemic areas, parasitemia does not ensure a diagnosis of severe malaria because parasitemia can be incidental to other concurrent disease. The detection of malarial retinopathy is a candidate diagnostic test for cerebral malaria. Malarial retinopathy consists of a set of retinal abnormalities that is unique to severe malaria and common in children with cerebral malaria

The detection and assessment of leakage in retinal fluorescein angiogram images is important for the management of a wide range of retinal diseases. We have developed a framework that can automatically detect three types of leakage (large focal, punctate focal and vessel segment leakage).

This is a deep learning model created for the purpose of computer aided diagnosis of papilledema, vessel leakage, punctuate leakage, focal leakage and normal retinal images, a set of retinal abnormalities that is unique to severe malaria which is common in children with cerebral malaria
